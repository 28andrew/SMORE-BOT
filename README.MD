# SMOREBOT
SmoreBot is a Discord bot written by me (Andrew Tran) in my free time. It is written in Java and uses the [Java Discord API](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA). 
##FEATURES
- Annotation based command system
- Automatic Command Registration
- 3 Types of Commands:
  - Commands activated if starting with X
  - Commands activated if matching regex
  - Commands activated if matching exactly
- Console commands, works in IDE's terminals too
- ENUM based Rank System
- Configuration Manager/API
## USAGE
SmoreBot can be tested on the unofficial [Discord Bots](http://bots.discordapi.com/) server. Feel free to use my code for your own personal bot (not commerically used/for profit), but please don't name it Smore too.
## CONTRIBUTING
You can contribute by creating Pull Requests. The project uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for dependency management. I use [IntellIJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) but any IDE that supports Java should work.
